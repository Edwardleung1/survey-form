# survey-form
This is a project provided by freeCodecamp on the responsive web design section. 
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get 
some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not 
recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk.
